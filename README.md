dynamically generate a professional README.md file from a user's input


# 09 Node.js: Professional README Generator

## Your Task


Your task is to create a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a user's input using the [Inquirer package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer). Review the [Professional README Guide](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/github/professional-readme-guide) as a reminder of everything that a high-quality, professional README should contain. 


Youâ€™ll need to submit a link to a video demonstrating the application _and_ add it to the README of your project.

## Getting Started

Use the following questions as a guide:

What was your motivation?
Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
What problem does it solve?
What did you learn?
What makes your project stand out?
Your README might also describe some of the challenges you faced, as well as the features you plan to implement in the future. And if your project is deployed, make sure to include a link to the deployed application so people can see it in action!
